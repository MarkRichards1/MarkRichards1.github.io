The forklift's center of gravity moves when you accelerate, brake, or turn. With a capacity to pack them one on top of each other, our range of material handling equipment reduces the transporting time by half.</p>

<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
