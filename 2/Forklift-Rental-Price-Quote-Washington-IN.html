<h3>Forklift Rental Service Washington IN 47501</h3>
<p>The most complex type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit, which allows your truck to be boosted higher than that of a body kit. Yale has been manufacturing materials handling equipment for over 140 years. Since 1949, Kalmar has been the preferred brand among quality-aware, heavy lift truck drivers and owners.

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
