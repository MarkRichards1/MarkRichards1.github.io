<p>At Ahern Rentals, we have the rental equipment that you need for your next project. Standup forklifts are "step in step out" minimizing the amount of time an operator spends mounting the truck. We buy and sell used forklifts, aerial lifts, rail car movers, attachments, racking & shelving and surplus warehouse equipment. The 2C5000 became the primary model in 2010 and had maintained its status as one of the premier forklift models ever since.</p>

<p>Beyond that, many workers can also be injured when (1) lift trucks are inadvertently driven off loading docks; (2) lifts fall between docks and an unsecured trailer; (3) they are struck by a lift truck; or (4) they fall while on elevated pallets and tines. While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>
