<p>By control, by type, by load capacity, by end use industry and by region, to offer insights on the global Pallet Trucks market. Rough terrain forklift operation requires the driver to be constantly aware of the ground surface conditions in the direction of movement, and requires focused attention at every phase of the task at hand. In such scenarios, Forklift Trucks play an important role in the food and beverage industry.</p>
<p>And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble. OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
