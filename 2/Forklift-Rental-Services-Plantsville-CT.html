<p>You can already see that lifted trucks have some real advantages when it comes to going off-road, thanks to the greater clearance they enjoy. Operators should be trained to operate the type of trucks they work on. They should also know the potential risks for each model. Descriptive, task-oriented names (such as side loader, high-lift pallet‚Äù forklift) aside, forklifts are often referred to in more colloquial terms.</p>

And the money you save by leasing can be put into what matter most: growing the business.</p>

Our friendly and knowledgable forklift sales staff will do a full site assessment to identify the best new forklift for you. Another place where pallet trucks are very useful and can often be found is in loading docks.</p>
