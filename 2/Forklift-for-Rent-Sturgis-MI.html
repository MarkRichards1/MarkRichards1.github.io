The smaller design and increased maneuverability of narrow aisle forklifts allow them to reach tight areas and readily respond to unexpected hazards effectively. Meanwhile, Crown introduced a new 2-stage TL mast , commonly referred to as a Truckers Mast,” for its Crown FC 5200 Series counterbalance forklifts and the pneumatic and cushion tire models of the Crown C-5 Series industrial forklifts.</p>

Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
<p>Lifted trucks also present a danger to those driving in them.
