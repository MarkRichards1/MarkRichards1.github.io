In 2018, the Chinese market maintained rapid growth, with the fork sales outnumbering 500,000 units in the first ten months of 2018 and expectedly approaching 600,000 units throughout the year. Loop handle is spring loaded to return to upright position and eliminate bending to retrieve.

<h2>Interesting Forklift Facts and History in Little Falls </h2>
<p>If you rent forklift then it will work as a power based truck to lift and move industrial and raw materials. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents. In order to prevent the lift from tipping, the combined center of gravity of the load and the lift must stay inside the stability triangle (at ground level) at all times.</p>
<p>With Firestone's air helper spring kits, you can increase your vehicles load capacity up to 5,000 lbs. The forklift experts at Northland Industrial Truck Co., better known throughout New England as NITCO , have hundreds of rental units on hand and are skilled at helping you figure out what options are right for your business. Long Term forklift rentals give you all the benefits of use with none of the risks of ownership.</p>

<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation.
