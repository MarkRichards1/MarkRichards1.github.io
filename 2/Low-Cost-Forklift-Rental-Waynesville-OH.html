<h3>High Lift Pallet Truck Waynesville OH 45068</h3>
<p>LP engines, propane, diesel forklifts and more. Choosing the right forklift is important for your business. That also means you can take your lifted truck off the beaten path and drive it hard.

Order pickers have a different steering control and they can turn sharper than a usual forklift.</p>

A forklift that is overloaded while lifting a load at height can very easily tip over forwards, with potential of causing serious damage to property, equipment, and people.
