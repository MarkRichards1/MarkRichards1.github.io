<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>Telehandlers are four-wheel drive trucks with long attachments with forks in the end for lifting pallets and other equipment. Our range of second hand order pickers make for faster, more accurate order picking. You'll also want to make sure your truck can handle the added weight of larger tires, especially if you aren't specifically doing anything to the suspension itself.</p>
