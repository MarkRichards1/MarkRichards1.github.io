<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory. For anyone interested in some serious off-roading, lifted trucks can be a great way to take your experience to the next level and conquer all-new trails. As a matter of fact, we specialize in bringing southern trucks to the midwest for all of our customers. Make sure that the lifted truck has modified brakes with larger than normal rotors and calipers that are capable of stopping the truck in a reasonable distance.</p>
<p>That's why our focus is making the forklift rental process quick and easy, without the usual red tape and fine print of the big rental companies. The 37-inch-wide C-G chassis—about five to six inches narrower than the chassis of a typical 4,000 to 7,000 lb. forklift—allows C-G Series forklifts to navigate tight rack storage aisles. Our stores in Sacramento, CA and throughout northern central California are fully equipped to meet your demands for rental forklifts.</p>

Customization and accessories for trucks go beyond what the manufacturer offers on brand new models, however, giving truck drivers even more freedom to make their pickups their own.
