<h2>Hand Pallet Truck Mapleton</h2>
<p>Forklifts are powered industrial trucks used to lift and move materials in short distances. Operators get excellent visibility with panoramic views of rack, loads and aisle. Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments and is popular for use in large distribution centers.</p>
<p>The first thing when it comes to owning lifted trucks is to understand how you'd like to spend your money. Full Free Lift = A truck where the fork carriage travels to the top of the inner mast before the inner mast begins to rise. Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Pinch point hazards are also common when operating this type of forklift truck.</p>

One of our most popular and material handling equipment in demand is Electric Pallet Trucks. Highly versatile low-lift pallet skid handler for loads 3,000 - 8,000lbs.

If you've never rented before, you might be surprised at the actual forklift rental cost and how affordable it can be. However, statistics show that companies that own their fleets tend to keep their forklifts longer than financially makes sense.</p>
