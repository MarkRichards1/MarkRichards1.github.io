We provide machines to suit all purposes from a variety of manufacturers and constantly rotate our stock because we also purchase your second hand forklifts and provide part exchange. They serve a different kind of job to the counterbalance forklift in a number of ways.</p>

Our friendly and knowledgable forklift sales staff will do a full site assessment to identify the best new forklift for you. Another place where pallet trucks are very useful and can often be found is in loading docks.</p>
