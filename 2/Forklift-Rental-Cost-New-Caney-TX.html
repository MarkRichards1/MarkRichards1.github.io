Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. The Industrial Truck Association (ITA, ) has defined seven classes of lift trucks, or forklifts, which are defined by the type of engine, work environment, operator position and equipment characteristics. In some cases, you may be looking to expand your business or take on work that requires equipment you don't have, like a forklift.</p>

<p>The U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) has guidelines in place to help forklift operators, pallet jack drivers, and other industrial powered truck workers be aware of their machine's ability to lift, maneuver, and store cargo. When it's done right, you can expect a lifted Jeep to have better pulling power, a greater capacity to off-road because of its increased clearance, and the ability to use a much larger set of off-road tires.</p>
<p>Towing: It's easier to tow heavier loads with a lifted truck since your truck won't be as at high of risk of bottoming out. If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. From lifting items into the shipping trucks to stocking things away in storage, their maneuverability lends well to various working environments and conditions.</p>

<p>LP engines, propane, diesel forklifts and more. Choosing the right forklift is important for your business. That also means you can take your lifted truck off the beaten path and drive it hard. But for serious off-road enthusiasts, getting a truck lifted or buying an existing lifted truck should certainly be a consideration at least. Order pickers have a different steering control and they can turn sharper than a usual forklift.</p>
<p>These types of powered industrial trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and have pneumatic (air filled) tires. Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
