<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>

<h2>Lifts For Trucks Spring Valley</h2>
<p>Body lift kits work to lift the body of the vehicle but continues to keep the chassis and suspension at the same height in relation to the ground. This is a unique walkie counterbalance truck which was designed to operate in a large chemical manufacturing facility. At the end of the day, lifting your truck can help you improve its look and performance, but you need to be confident in the work being done and the folks who are doing it.
