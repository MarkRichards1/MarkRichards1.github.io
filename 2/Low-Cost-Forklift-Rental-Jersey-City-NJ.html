This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life.

<p>If you do decide to go ahead and lift your truck, take extra care when operating it to ensure safety, and check everything underneath regularly for wear and tear to prevent and accelerated damage that may occur.
