<p>The lifting capacity of the pallet trucks and pallet lift trucks from Linde ranges from 500 to 3.300 kg.

<p>Before you decide to lift your truck, it's important to understand some of the pros and cons of driving a lifted vehicle. If your forklift is overloaded, it can cause it to tip to the side when you turn or when you are near a steep edge. Forklifts run on diesel, liquid propane and electric. If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>
<p>On certain types of trucks, the weight on the braking wheel (s) may be insufficient to attain drawbar drag values required for higher combinations of ramp and speed. But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature. Turret trucks or Swing-Reach® can work in aisles as narrow as 60”, and are used for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.</p>

<p>The majority of fatalities stem from forklift turnovers, so an obvious advantage of pushing a cart as opposed to sitting in a vehicle is not going down with the ship, so to speak, if it slips off a loading dock or tips due to an unbalanced load.
