In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks. A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>For others, it's the enhanced functionality and driver satisfaction that makes these trucks attractive choice. Standard forklifts have little ground clearance as they are predominantly operated on solid smooth surfaces such as concrete floors. Toyota forklifts are designed and manufactured from the ground up with operator safety, comfort, productivity and efficiency in mind.</p>
