<p>Here's a quick look at a few common hazards associated with forklifts. Often a large forklift load obstructs the driver's view in one direction. Apart from this, these rental services are rendered according to the client's demands. They work better than 4-wheel forklifts where space is limited. This product range is capable of moving the heavy loads very easily and for the packing goods in warehouses, stores and factories.</p>

They provide equipment for residential, commercial, industrial, and specialized services across all 50 states. Also called a pump truck, a pallet jack is smaller in size than the above mentioned forklifts.</p>
<p>Off-roading tests the limits of both your Jeep and you as a driver. There are extensive ranges of forklifts available which include pedestrian operated machines to heavy duty driver operated trucks. The special handle design offers protection for the operator's handle and makes raising loads and steering easier. These forklifts travel at high and fast speeds. Battery Operated Pallet Trucks are used to lift and move pallets.</p>

For nearly 50 years, customers have relied on the Cat lift trucks brand for quality and reliable forklifts backed by exceptional service and support through its trusted dealer network. If your company has a forklift that's dead in the water, ForkliftTrader does on-site service calls.</p>
