<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory. For anyone interested in some serious off-roading, lifted trucks can be a great way to take your experience to the next level and conquer all-new trails. As a matter of fact, we specialize in bringing southern trucks to the midwest for all of our customers. Make sure that the lifted truck has modified brakes with larger than normal rotors and calipers that are capable of stopping the truck in a reasonable distance.</p>
<p>However, industrial-grade masts do reportedly provide more substantial lifting capacity at height, with 6,000-lb and 8,000-lb capacity lifts serving as two popular examples among a number of rental houses. Their manoeuvrability, tires and traction force make them very popular in industries where very heavy loads must be transported on rough or unpaved grounds.</p>

From new and used sales to fleet financing solutions to servicing and maintenance, your local Cat lift trucks and warehouse equipment dealer is ready to help when needed.

Remember that the price of the equipment isn't the only cost you'll incur if you purchase a forklift.</p>
<h2>Hand Pallet Springfield</h2>
<p>These sorts of lifted trucks drive differently than stock models, due to the change of suspension and higher center of gravity, but can utilize mush larger tires than a factory model. Advances in machinery made life easier for warehouse personnel; one of these important innovations was the pallet jack, which is basically a type of forklift. Many of the most serious forklift accidents happen when a driver drops a payload.</p>

<p>Lift Capacity: 14000 lbs. Forklifts are designed to lessen the load for you. Powered by industrial batteries, these lift trucks use transistor motor controllers to control travel and hoisting movements. We are a full service rental store with reliable fleet of fully maintained general construction equipment and specialty equipment like reach forklift, telescopic handler, telescopic forklift and forklift rental; for commercial, industrial, residential and do-it-yourselfers.</p>
