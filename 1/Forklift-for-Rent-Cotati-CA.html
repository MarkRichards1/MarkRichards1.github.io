<h2>How To Make The Right Choice To Buy Used Forklifts Cotati </h2>
<p>Designed to increase productivity when handling heavy loads, the innovative and unique BT Pro Lifter model LHM230P requires up to 67% less force than a standard hand pallet truck to begin moving. Pallet jacks - also called order pickers, typical pallet jacks can lift approximately 3,300 pounds. DaytonÂ® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>
