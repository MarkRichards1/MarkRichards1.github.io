<h2>Forklift Sales & Service In Medford </h2>

<h2>Electric Reach Truck Medford</h2>
<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>Buy Forklifts in bulk from us for the best quality products and service. A lifted suspension, though it's protected from scraping over rocks and debris, responds differently to this stress; if you lift your Jeep's suspension, your standard shocks might not do the trick. Its optimized design and 68.5” truck length - the shortest in the industry - ensures it can maneuver where no other 3-wheel counterbalance forklift can.</p>

<p>Telescopic forks - hydraulic attachments that allow the operator to operate in warehouse design for "double-deep stacking", which means that two pallet shelves are placed behind each other without any aisle between them.
