<h2>Working With A Forklift Or Pallet Jacks South Portland </h2>
<p>Designed for the operator to ride up on the platform and pull product. From electric pallet jacks to narrow aisle lift trucks or sit-down rider forklifts, we'll help you find exactly what you need and get it to your facility when you need it. Any surface a forklift drives on must be able to support the forklift and its load with a safety factor of four. If you intend to go beyond a short-term rental, consider talking with your local MCFA lift truck dealer first to make sure you get the most out of your forklift rental.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>We only sell forklifts that we are confident to be a great value for the condition it is in. Through our connections and many resources, we are always adding units to our inventory, giving you a wide selection of makes and models to suit the needs of your operation. Renting equipment provides a fixed monthly cost that can be written off as an operating expense, allowing you to stabilize your operating budget.</p>
