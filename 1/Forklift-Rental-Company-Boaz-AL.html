<h2>Fork Lifting Training Boaz</h2>
<p>Capable of lifting 20,000 pounds, this is the latest of Load Lifter's high-visibility forklifts. The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of Narrow-Aisle-Rider fork trucks having rated capacities up to and including 10,000 lb at 24-inch load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities. If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parries.</p>
<p>OSHA requires that all forklift operators' performances be evaluated at least once every three years. With more than 50 models to choose from, our forklifts are manufactured with superior quality. This type of forklift is suited for uneven surfaces with its sturdy pneumatic tires. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>
