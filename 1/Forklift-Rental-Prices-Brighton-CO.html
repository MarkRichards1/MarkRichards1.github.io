<p>When standard pallet sizes launched in 1930, forklifts became even more useful. However, to maximize the benefits you can gain from a short-term forklift rental, you need to understand lift truck rental agreements and how they align to the needs of your specific business.

This is highlighted by the impressive load capacity: Our low-level order pickers, for instance, can lift up to three pallets weighing up to 2.5 tons with their 2.4 metre long forks.

At a minimum, you should have a card or certificate of proof of training and the vehicle load charts (and attachment load charts as well, if applicable) on the jobsite—OSHA will look for these items first. In an effort to stand out but also fluently head off road and through disastrous weather conditions, we at Lewisville Autoplex Preowned suggest you try a custom lifted truck or Jeep vehicle.</p>
