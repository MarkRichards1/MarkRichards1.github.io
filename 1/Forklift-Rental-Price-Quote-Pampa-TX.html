<p>While electric forklifts will require less maintenance, they will never be maintenance free. To achieve worker safety, Raymond developed the Raymond virtual reality (VR) simulator , a supplemental educational tool that helps new and experienced operators learn and practice forklift operating skills on an actual truck in a secure, warehouse environment. They feature specially-designed lifting carriages and come in two configurations: with mast and with reach.</p>
<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>

My "beater" 4WD has a 3" lift kit that gives it about a 10" minimum ground clearance-more than enough clearance to handle some quite nasty trails-but I actually use my 4WD for both work and pleasure in areas where such capability is a necessity.</p>
