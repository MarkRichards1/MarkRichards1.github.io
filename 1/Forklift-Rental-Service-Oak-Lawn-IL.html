<h2>Electric Pallet Trucks Oak Lawn </h2>
<p>In an Order Picking Forklift the Operator goes up into the air with the load and either places pallets mechanically, or moves smaller loads on and off the order picker manually. Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6” suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>If you wish to eventually own your own forklift, we recommend that you consider the rent-to-own package that we have to offer. Order picking operations are often faced with seasonal fluctuations in the number of trucks and operators they need. View our entire inventory of New or Used Order Picker Truck Equipment.
