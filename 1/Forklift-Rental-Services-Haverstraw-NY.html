On October 4, 2017, United Rentals announced it had acquired the assets of Superior Speedie Portable Services, Inc. With proper care and maintenance, a lifted truck provides many benefits for the off-road adventure seeker. We offer to our clients a Hydraulic Hand Pallet Truck that has high load bearing capacity and is provided with nylon wheels for quiet and smooth rolling over rough surfaces.</p>
<p>About 41% of these are forklifts, 1% are truck body parts, and 1% are digital signage and displays. Knowing your specific needs and what forklift type best fits your application is very important when renting equipment for your job site.

<p>We offer our customers access to both Factory New as well as Pre-Owned forklift trucks. At Granite Industrial Trucks we are ready to meet the needs of your company today.
