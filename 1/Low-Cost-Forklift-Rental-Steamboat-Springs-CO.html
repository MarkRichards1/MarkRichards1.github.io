<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. The Industrial Truck Association (ITA, ) has defined seven classes of lift trucks, or forklifts, which are defined by the type of engine, work environment, operator position and equipment characteristics. In some cases, you may be looking to expand your business or take on work that requires equipment you don't have, like a forklift.</p>

When it comes to forklift sales, it's important to find a reliable dealer who you can trust to provide a value-for-money solution. Manual pallet jacks have a capacity of about 5500 lbs. The scale of materials transported and lifts used varies greatly depending on the type of industry in question.</p>

The optional light and fan package offers enhanced lighting on the operator's platform, allowing enhanced visibility when order picking.</p>
