Rough terrain forklifts evolved from standard forklifts. Better Equipment: In addition to freeing up capital , leasing a forklift usually results in getting better equipment than you could afford to buy.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
